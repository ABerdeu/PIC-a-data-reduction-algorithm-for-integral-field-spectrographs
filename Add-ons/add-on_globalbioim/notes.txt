My modification to the official GlobalBioIm (files with "my_" prefixe)
-> Problem with LinOpConv and centered 'PSF'. Wrong use of fftshift
-> Modification of LinOpSelectorPatch to squeeze singleton dimensions
-> New definition of CostL1 for positivity or negativity constraints to compute the gradient on singleton dimensions
-> Error in CostHyperBolic for index == 0
-> Error in LinOpBroadcast for vectors. Modification of the squeeze option in applyAdjoint_ by a reshape. Indeed, there is a problem in the case of vectors as inputs.

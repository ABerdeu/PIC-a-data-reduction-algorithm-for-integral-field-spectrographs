Add-ons -> general toolboxes needed for the different procedures

- GlobalBioIm: Matlab toolbox that contains generic modules that facilitate the implementation of forward models and optimization algorithms (see https://biomedical-imaging-group.github.io/GlobalBioIm/)

- add-on_globalbioim: dedicated add-ons to the GlobalBioIm library for PIC

- toolbox: general functions used by the different algorithms of PIC
